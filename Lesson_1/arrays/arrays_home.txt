Arrays [1..7]
1. Revert the array:

Given an array of integers of some size, implement a function
that reverts this array. For example:

Initial array is:  [-1, 5, 2, 7, 4]
Reverted array is: [4, 7, 2, 5, -1]

Make your soultion to have time complexity of O(n).

Arrays [8..15]
1. Test Stack implementation:

Use std::stack<int> from <stack> header file and write some unit tests
for each stack's basic operations, such as push(), pop().

2. Test Queue implementation:

Use std::queue<int> from <queue> header file and write some unit tests
for each queue's basic operations, such as enqueue(), dequeue().

3. Implement Queue using two different Stacks.

4. Implement a function maxInStack(), which returns a maximum value
in stack. Each time one can push some value in Stack or pop it,
and maxInStack() must always give a correct result.

5. Implement a function maxinQueue(), as mentioned above.

6. Using an std::vector<int> from <vector> header file, write
function, which keeps a vector always sorted. You should add new
values in vector keeping it's sorted order.

7. Compare time performance of SortedLinkedList and sorted vector.
Add a lot of values and measure times it had taken.

8. Implement double-linked-list: in such list each node has pointers both
to the next and to the previous nodes. Implement push_front() function, which
pushes new value to the front of the linked list.

9. Make your double-linked-list always sorted. Also, compare time performance
both with one-linked-list and std::vector.
